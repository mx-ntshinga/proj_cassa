Issue: message="Batch too large"
================================
Changes: 
	tombstone_failure_threshold: 500000
	write_request_timeout_in_ms: 10000
	range_request_timeout_in_ms: 40000 (from  )

	tombstone_warn_threshold:  100000
	tombstone_failure_threshold:  50000000

	# Log WARN on any batch size exceeding this value. 5kb per batch by default.
	# Caution should be taken on increasing the size of this threshold as it can lead to node instability.
	batch_size_warn_threshold_in_kb: 500000

	# Fail any batch exceeding this value. 50kb (10x warn threshold) by default.
	batch_size_fail_threshold_in_kb: 5000000

	To change:
		request_timeout_in_ms
	You may want to increment the request timeout (default: 10 seconds)  

Multiple partition logged batch
--- use "BEGIN LOGGED BATCH"

For timeout errors:
	cqlsh --request-timeout=6000

----WARNING!: Queries on secondary indices are restrictive - you can't do range queries for example - you're limited to = checks.

Solution: Connection error: ('Unable to connect to any servers', {'127.0.0.1': ...',)})
